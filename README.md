# Team Profile Generator
## Description
The Team Profile Generator is a functiional node application that allows the user to create a list of employment for a company. The user can choose from a manager, employee, or intern; their ID number, email, and office number. You can add as many team members as you would like, and the application will display everyone on the team. Most of the application is performed through simple javascript that creates and renders an HTML file, with some basic CSS added.

## Usage
  In order to use the application, the user must first install it. The user should go to the terminal and run 'npm i', then 'node index.js'. The terminal will then ask the user which type of team member they would like to add. They'll click on Employee, Manager, or Intern. The application will then ask their ID number and office number, which the user will fill out accordingly. Depending on which team member the employee chose, the application will either ask for their email (manager), github(employee), or college(intern). Once the user fills all of the information out, they will get sent back to the 'add member' prompt, this time being able to choose 'I would not like to add anymore team members'. Once they add their team members and select that option, an HTML page will then be created for them, which they can open up and view. This will show everyone on the team in a card, all of their ID numbers, office numbers, and contact info.
